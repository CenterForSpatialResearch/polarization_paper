        <p>The word “homophily” was coined in a 1954 paper by Paul F. Lazarsfeld
and Robert K. Merton in an influential study of friendship in a mixedrace housing project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The researchers were
suspicious of the “familiar and egregiously misleading question: do
birds of a feather flock together?”1
 They concluded that friendships
form and persist not simply on the basis of shared identities but also
thanks to shared values and beliefs. They focused on “racial attitudes.”
The afterlife of the concept has been remarkable. Today, the
assumption of homophily underlies social and economic interactions
online, as platforms reinforce the axiom that “similarity breeds
connection.” What began as a description of social life has become a rule for algorithms shaping social interactions online.</p>

      A Concept Born in a Mixed-Race
      Housing Project
      Merton, a sociologist, directed the Columbia-Lavanburg Studies of
      the Social Organization of Housing Communities. Beginning in 1947,
      Columbia University researchers conducted a survey of residents
      of Addison Terrace, in Pittsburgh, to try to understand the effects of
      “tenant morale” on the success of housing projects. At the time of the
      study, Addison Terrace had recently been completed. Built with federal
      funding for public housing made available for the first time through the
      Housing Act of 1937, the project was dedicated by President Franklin
      Delano Roosevelt in 1940. It was demolished in 2015.

      In a 1951 essay commissioned for the Columbia-Lavanburg project,
      prominent progressive housing advocate Catherine Bauer questioned
      the assumption that cohesive neighborhoods are dependent on “a high
      degree of social similarity” and echoed the liberal optimism of the
      time that social science research would help in reversing patterns of
      segregation.

     <p>To study social dynamics within planned public housing communities, Merton, together with
     researchers Patricia Salter West and Marie Jahoda, conducted an extensive survey of residents at
     Addison Terrace, which they code-named “Hilltown.”</p>
